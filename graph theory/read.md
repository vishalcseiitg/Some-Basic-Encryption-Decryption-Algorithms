An encryption-decryption algorithm using the concepts of graph theory could be based on the idea of representing the message as a graph and using graph transformations to encrypt and decrypt the message. Here's an outline of one such algorithm:

1. Represent the message as a graph, where each node represents a letter or a symbol in the message, and each edge represents a relationship between two symbols.
2. Choose a set of graph transformations, such as vertex permutations, edge reordering, and subgraph substitution.
3. Choose a key, which could be a sequence of transformations to apply to the graph.
4. Apply the key to the graph to encrypt the message.
5. The encrypted message is the transformed graph.
6. To decrypt the message, simply invert the sequence of transformations in the key and apply it to the encrypted graph.
