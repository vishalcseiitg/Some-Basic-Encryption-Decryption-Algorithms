Using semaphores for encryption and decryption is not a common approach, as semaphores are typically used for interprocess communication and synchronization in operating systems. However, one possible way to use semaphores for encryption and decryption is as follows:

1. Define a semaphore called "key" that is initialized with a value of 1.

2. To encrypt a message, first acquire the "key" semaphore. Then, for each character in the message, add a fixed value (e.g., 3) to its ASCII code to produce the encrypted character. Release the "key" semaphore.

3. To decrypt a message, first acquire the "key" semaphore. Then, for each character in the message, subtract the same fixed value (e.g., 3) from its ASCII code to produce the decrypted character. Release the "key" semaphore.

Note that this simple algorithm is not secure and can be easily broken by an attacker who knows the fixed value used for encryption and decryption. It is provided only as an example of how semaphores could be used in an encryption and decryption algorithm.
