Key Generation: The key generation process is the first step in the algorithm. The key is a sequence of random numbers that are generated using a cryptographic random number generator. The length of the key will determine the strength of the encryption.

Encryption: To encrypt the plaintext message, the message is first broken up into blocks of a fixed size. For each block, a random sequence of numbers is generated using a cryptographic random number generator. This random sequence is XORed with the key to produce a new sequence of numbers. The original block is then XORed with the new sequence of numbers. The resulting ciphertext is a sequence of XORed blocks.

Decryption: To decrypt the ciphertext, the process is reversed. For each block of ciphertext, the random sequence of numbers that was generated during encryption is XORed with the key to produce a new sequence of numbers. The ciphertext block is then XORed with the new sequence of numbers to produce the original plaintext block. The resulting plaintext is a sequence of XORed blocks.

The security of this algorithm depends on the length of the key and the size of the blocks. Using longer keys and larger block sizes will increase the security of the algorithm. Additionally, the use of random sequences for each block ensures that any patterns in the plaintext are not visible in the ciphertext. Finally, the use of a cryptographic random number generator ensures that the key and random sequences are truly random and cannot be easily guessed or predicted.

Overall, this algorithm is relatively simple to implement and provides a good level of security. However, as with any encryption algorithm, it is important to keep the key secret and protect it from being compromised.
