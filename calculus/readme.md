One potential encryption-decryption algorithm that uses concepts from calculus is the "Calculus-based Encryption Algorithm." Here's how it works:

1. Key Generation: To generate a key, first choose two large prime numbers, p and q. Then, find their product, n = p * q. Choose a function f(x) that is easily computable and has a unique inverse, g(x), over the interval [0, n-1]

2. Encryption: To encrypt a message m, first convert it into a numerical representation using a numerical encoding scheme. Let the numerical representation be m1. Then, compute c1 = f(m1) mod n, where mod n means taking the remainder after division by n. The encrypted message is c1.

3. Decryption: To decrypt the encrypted message c1, compute m1 = g(c1) mod n. Convert m1 back into its original form using the numerical encoding scheme to get the original message m.

4. Security: The security of the Calculus-based Encryption Algorithm is based on the difficulty of finding the inverse of the function f(x) over the interval [0, n-1]. If an attacker tries to find the inverse without knowing n, they will not be able to determine the original message as the inverse would not be unique over the entire domain.
